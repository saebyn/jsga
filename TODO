Now:

* Keep a log of population activity in localstorage

  - which organisms reproduced

  - which children the organism has each generation

  - how many generations the organism lived

  - which other organisms the organism bred with each generation to produce its children

Sooner:

* Allow the user to view the log of population activity related to a specific organism

* Generate population statistics from log

Later:

* Web workers?

* Update backbone.js and other deps

* Allow mutiple chromosomes ( with different lengths and bases )

* Support visualization of chromosomes with non-flat structure

* Support multiple species (Organism.type) in the population.

* Add my notes from my GA book into here and do them :)

* Combine JS Files : use https://github.com/matt-hh/middleman-jammit

* Move more JS to bottom of page
