Now:

* Fix up creation form and build some sample experiments to be preloaded

  - write explaination of pd

* Allow the user to set the random seed during creation

  - Fix specs that rely on mocking random to instead use seed


Sooner:

* Consider making counts in cooccurance graph displayed in a logarithmic scale

* Multipoint crossover

  - UI: how many points? distribution??

* Generate population statistics from log

  - allele cooccurance (http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/)

    - do cluster analysis

    - filterable by generation range, fitness range 

* Show alert when population log gets too big.


Later:

* Control random distributions (presets, manually specified by UI??) for various mechanisms

* Crossover hotspots - GA driven multipoint crossover point distribution selection

* Adaptive mutation rates

  - Functionally driven by overall chromosome features vs specific features

  - Hotspots, base locus selection random distribution driven by separate GA (like chromosome hotspots)

* Genotype / Phenotype distinctions
  
  - grammar encoding: pg 72

  - gray coded integers in chromosome bitstring

* Write help page

* Add optional Sigma scaling of fitness

* Web workers?

  - statistics aggregation for graphs

  - fitness function evaluations

* Allow mutiple chromosomes ( with different lengths and bases )

* Support visualization of chromosomes with non-flat structure

* Support multiple species (Organism.type) in the population.

* Add my notes from my GA book into here and do them :)

* Combine JS Files : use https://github.com/matt-hh/middleman-jammit

* Move more JS to bottom of page
