Now:

* Create and keep a log of population activity

Sooner:

* Allow the user to view the log of population activity related to a specific organism

* Generate population statistics from log

Later:

* Allow mutiple chromosomes ( with different lengths and bases )

* Support visualization of chromosomes with non-flat structure

* Support multiple species (Organism.type) in the population.

* Add my notes from my GA book into here and do them :)
